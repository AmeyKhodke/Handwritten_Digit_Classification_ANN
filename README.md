Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the bank) based on demographic and financial attributes. The dataset used is Churn_Modelling.csv, which contains 10,000 customer records.

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for improving customer retention and reducing business losses. In this project, we:
Import and explore the dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Preprocess and encode categorical data
Build an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras
Train and evaluate the model
Predict customer churn
